Another weekend, and I realize I am not energetic enough these days for
anything. Maybe it is time to start a new, fun side project to keep myself
busy. Another CRUD app would not be that interesting, and I also want to stay
away from the kind of web app / tech I work on in the day job. I figure it
might be cool to make some games.

## Game Development
Game Development is very hard and involved. There are many different components
like graphics, AI, audio, art, game design, story, game logic, networking,
animation etc that require
deep knowledge in many different domains. As a hobbyist it is not possible to
master every single thing, so we should really set our own expectation on the
outcome carefully.

Luckily, we will be having a lot of freedom on the every aspect of the game
and will not have any deadlines to meet. Therefore, we should target to have
some fun while learning something new along the way.

## Experience
The only experience I have on game development was the [CS50's introduction
to game development course][gd50], and the final project that I built for it,
[a classic tower defense game][my-game] using typescript/[phaser][phaser]. It
was simple yet fun, but these were all 2+ years ago.

## Plan
I am still thinking about what to build this time, but it would probably be
some simple 2D rougelike of some sorts. I would use the book [Game Coding
Complete][game-coding-complete] as a reference. The book uses
Windows/DirectX, but since I am on Linux, I might have to use OpenGL instead.
Hopefully it would not be hard to carry the same concepts to a different API
on the fly.

I am going to be blogging about everything about this game's creation and the
things I learn on the way. Although very likely I myself would be the only
reader of these posts, but it would probably help me to slow down and really
think through stuffs, so why not?
